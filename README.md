# Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to the **Learning Projects Repository**! This repository is dedicated to small, hands-on projects aimed at learning and practicing data analysis techniques. Each project focuses on a specific aspect of data analysis, providing an opportunity to explore various tools, libraries, and methodologies.

## Projects

### 1. Comparing Stock Prices Over Time
**Objective:** Analyze and visualize the stock prices of Intel (INTC) and Apple (AAPL) over time to identify trends and patterns.

**Description:**
- This project uses Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for visualization.
- The data is fetched and processed using a utility function (`get_dataframe`) to retrieve stock price data for the specified tickers.
- The stock prices of Intel and Apple are merged into a single DataFrame and plotted for comparison.

**Key Features:**
- Data fetching and preprocessing.
- Merging datasets for comparative analysis.
- Visualization of stock price trends over time.

**Files:**
- `utils.py`: Contains utility functions for data fetching.
- `visualize_script.py`: Script for generating visualizations.
- `visualizing_stock_prices.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis.
